## This is created for a Flatiron School Portfolio Project

# React Redux Portfolio Project

## Overview
This assignment is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates most of what you've learned in this course.

---

The requirements for this project are:
  + The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
  + Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.
  + Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app
  + Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
  + There should be 2 container components
  + There should be 5 stateless components
  + There should be 3 routes
  + The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the  appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)
  + Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
  + Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
  + Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
  + Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
  + Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write + (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
  + Go wild! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.
